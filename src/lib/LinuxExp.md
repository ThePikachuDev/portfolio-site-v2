# Windows sucks

<br>

everyone starts with windows when they got new pc and have zero programming Expereince . I also started my coding journey on windows 10 when i got my new pc. 

I was then just an average vs code user and a so cold full stack developer . i was doing good on windows also but it had it owns problems and limitations like i hate windows updating system , it is very annyoing get a update pop up while doing something on your pc and there are many ways to get virus and malwares on your computer while browsing or downloading something . The performance was also not great . for instance when i was on windows i could barely open vs code , chrome and my discord with my ram and cpu usage spikes to 90% and cpu always staying at 70 degree plus temperature .

<br>

# Transitioning to linux 

<br>

One day my pc stops working due to overheighting of my cpu ( 90 degree plus at desktop ) , i cleaned my pc's cabinet and replaced the thermal paste over it but it was still high , so i got very very frustrated and started my research about linux and which distro i should use. 

I ended up with linux mint after some days of research , so i took my 16gb usb stick and booted up linux mint and completely deleted windows from my pc . it was fresh and a satisfying expereince afterall.

<br>

# The Distro hooping 
<br>

I used linux mint for 1 or 2 months and I hightly recommend begginner to start with linux mint . it was a very clean experience, i didn't touched my terminal once except installing some apps. 

after some time , i saw fedora linux and it was fabolous .It looked cool and it was pretty stable and had a cool software store. so i again booted up usb drive and installed fedora 40.i also tried nixos in between but for just 30 minutes at max.

# The hyprland arc

<br>

after setting up my os for work and studies , i saw r/unixporn posts , they were so cool and amazing . so i decided to give it a shot and i installed and riced hyprland by typecraft's [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CP_9-jCV6A&list=PLsz00TDipIfeDrFeSA56W1wPrYYg_Kd-b) they were pretty good and helpfull. i tried other windows tilling managers as well like i3wm. they all were pretty good but they also requires a lot of efforts to get started as well. 

this is the time when i actually started using my terminal instead of that creppy electron and gui apps . i leant neovim from primeagens [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6AR2RMB5tE&list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R) and also tried many cool cli tools like yazi, btop and many more.

but for now , i am convenced with gnome because it is simple and easy to use and i don't have to configure anything at all . 

<br>

My Current setup : 

- OS - Fedora
- DE - Gnome 
- Code Editor - Neovim BTW 
- Vencord as my Discord app
- Games - Minecraft 
- browser - Brave
