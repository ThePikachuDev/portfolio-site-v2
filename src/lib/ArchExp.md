# The Arch linux experience 

<br>

you may have read my previous [blog](https://pikachusite.vercel.app/blogs/LinuxExp) and know about my experience with mint and fedora linux , so in this blog i will share my Arch linux experience , share some pretty good resources and also some cool tools that i am using in my current setup.


<br>

# Fedora to Arch Linux :

<br>

So i was booting my fedora system for like 3 to 4 months and i was pretty happy with my setup and i had learnt a bunch about cli and unix stuff to get comfortable with it. So i was pretty baised by the Arch linux beauty and things you can do on it and also i was feeling pretty bored with my setup ( Gnome ) and wanted to tryout something new and cool . so i booted up my usb pendrive with Arch iso and started installing Arch without using ArchInstall through this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/68z11VAYMS8?si=2Ncje1U8UHky9T8L) , yup i didn't followed the great Arch wiki because i didn't wanna waste many hours to just install an OS ( although i would learn much more this way ) , i will definetly use Arch wiki when i will install Arch 2nd time but for now i am happy with what i did : ) 

<br>

# My Arch Linux Setup : 

<br>

So when i freshly installed Arch , i installed KDE plasma as my desktop enviournment. I started installing all the goodies i need like ghostty ( which i replaced with kitty after some time ) , vesktop , zen browser etc. The Two main cool features for using Arch is the AUR packages and cool hyprland rices.I tried and learnt hyprland before on fedora by typecraft's [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz00TDipIfeDrFeSA56W1wPrYYg_Kd-b&si=1v_8W2UjE6cDv-zS),but i didn't wanted wanted rice it from scratch so i installed [Hyde's dotfiles](https://github.com/Hyde-project/hyde), it is pretty amazing and satisfying.
